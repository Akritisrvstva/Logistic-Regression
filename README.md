Introduction
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification problems, where the target variable has only two possible classes. It models the probability of the binary outcome using a logistic (sigmoid) function, which maps the input features to a probability range between 0 and 1.

Installation
To use the Logistic Regression Classifier, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install this package using pip:

sql
Copy code
pip install logistic-regression-classifier
Usage
To use the Logistic Regression Classifier, import it into your Python code
